** TODO Jeep Wrangler model in blender
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep_Wrangler
** TODO Rework objects into shape objects.
   The purpose of the DynamicBox, DynamicCylinder etc is to have a
   shape that nicely fits together with OpenSceneGraph view of everything.

   Really want to remodel the code and call them BoxShape, CylinderShape etc.
   This makes it possible to nicely put together compound objects etc.

** DONE Generate a bullet shape from osg model.
	blender -b dummy.blend -P blender_export.py -- dummy.dxf
** DONE Connect camera to the box.
   Slightly above and back of the box. This makes the camera follow the movements of the box.
** TODO Free mode camera and follow.
   You should be able to switch with a simple key command.
** TODO Find out the correct gravity for earth like conditions.
** DONE Add keyboard helper.
   h would bring up some help. Use the built in help system of open scene graph.
** DONE graphics archive
*** DONE Build target to create an osg archive
	rm 4wd.osga
	osgarchive -a 4wd.osga -i filename filename
	osgarchive -a 4wd.osga -l
	osgviewer 4wd.osga/myfile.ive
*** DONE Automatic export from blender to ive
	Every time a .blend file changes we do want to reexport that file and converted into
	.ive file format. Is this possible with some command line option to blender or do we
	need to write some python script?

	No command line option it seems. Python script is the way to do it I guess.
** DONE Add some physics object.
   Simple box falling to the ground would be enough.

This seems to fix issues when starting blender on my old laptop
